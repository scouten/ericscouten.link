For years I've seen people moan that "nobody blogs any more," all while my feed reader was overflowing with new blogposts I never had time to read. I want to demonstrate that there are lots and lots of people blogging, about all kinds of subjects!

<!-- more -->

Even though I knew there was a lot of blogging going on, I've been pleasantly surprised by quite how much. So many people, so many topics, so much enthusiasm. Itâ€™s easy to get lost down rabbitholes, following links and blogrolls from one blog to the next.
