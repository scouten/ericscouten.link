UniFFI is a tool that automatically generates foreign-language bindings targeting Rust libraries. The repository can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/mozilla/uniffi-rs/). It fits in the practice of consolidating business logic in a single Rust library while targeting multiple platforms, making it simpler to develop and maintain a cross-platform codebase.
