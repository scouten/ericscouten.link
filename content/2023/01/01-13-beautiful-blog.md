I ran across this article on the [hot mess that is YAML]((https://ruudvanasseldonk.com/2023/01/11/the-yaml-document-from-hell)) recently and enjoyed it for many reasons.

I've added Ruud's blog to my RSS because:

* We think alike (at least from the handful of articles I've read so far)
* His blog is infrequent (like my own [ericscouten.dev](https://ericscouten.dev))
* And the design is ðŸ”¥ hot
