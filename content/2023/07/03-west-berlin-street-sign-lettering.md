via [Dan Reynolds](https://typo.social/@typeoff/110648677371032177): Most designers I know love the West Berlin street sign lettering. It isn’t clear to me how much evidence researchers have found regarding its design and attribution. Last week I found a print from Ludwig Goller’s correspondence in the DIN Archive at the Deutsches Technikmuseum attributing the letters to Herbert Thannhäuser. This print is kept in SDTB I.3.015 DIN-Archiv 307/1.
