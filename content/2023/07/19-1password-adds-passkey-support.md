via [Stephen Shankland](https://mstdn.social/@stshank/110743336292257199): I predict that passkeys will be a big deal. In my tests using them for Google login, then with CVS just prompting me to migrate to them from password authentication, they were indeed pretty simple to use. 1Password is testing the ability to store passkeys and now the ability to unlock your passkey vault with passkeys.

_(My take: Though I haven't yet had the passkey experience, I whole-heartedly agree with Shankland's take here. I am excited to play with this when it moves into general availability.)_
