via [Boris Mann](https://cosocial.ca/@boris/110795171613918231): Kissane’s latest covers some “informal, conversational feedback” of people who had tried Mastodon but it hadn’t worked for them. This is really useful, primary research.

_(My take: My own Mastodon experience has been much more pleasant than described, but I fit the tech-focused stereotype of Mastodon users and I've very consciously steered away from engaging on political issues and other heated topics since departing Twitter. For those who want or need to engage in such, I am not all surprised to read of the challenges Kissane describes. Also, Erin Kissane is **so** worth following. As she says in her "about" page: "She remains ungovernably curious." Can confirm.)_
