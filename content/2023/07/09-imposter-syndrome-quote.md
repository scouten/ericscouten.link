Loving the [_Focused_ podcast](https://www.relay.fm/focused) that I happened onto recently.

This quote from a recent episode struck me as a brilliant reframe of imposter syndrome:

> Imposter syndrome never goes away, but it's really an indication that you care about the work that you're doing.

-- Justin Moore in _Focused_ podcast [Episode 181: Walking Your Own Path](https://overcast.fm/+QCTRKlXe8/56:48)
