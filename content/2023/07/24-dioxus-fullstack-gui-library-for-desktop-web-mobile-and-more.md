_(My take: I'm a bit wary of everything, everywhere frameworks which is what this claims to be. Having at one time or another written -- or at least been close to the writing of -- software for all of these platforms, they're _not_ alike. The abstraction to make them at all similar has got to be doing a lot of heavy lifting here. Would love to dig deeper on that someday.)_
