via [Miguel de Icaza](https://mastodon.social/@Migueldeicaza/110678261674512544): I have a nerd crush on DocC for documentation. So many good decisions, but also, what an amazing list of features that work out of the box.

It is a blessing to have a tool that is easy to use, but also that incentivizes the creation of good documents.
