> I changed servers on Mastodon last week and I learned a lot and I have opinions.
>
> To begin with, the best time to move from one home server to another (“migrate instances”) on Mastodon is _never_. The second-best time is _as soon as possible,_ because the longer you wait, the more you stand to lose in. But until you’ve been on Mastodon for a while, you aren’t going to know how well you get along with your server’s mod policy and administrators, and how your server’s reputation will affect your experience. It’s not ideal! But it’s what we have right now.

_(My take: This largely matches my own experience and has a lot to do with why I moved early on to establish -- and pay for -- my own Mastodon host. I am thankful for that option.)_
