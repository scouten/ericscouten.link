via [allison](https://friend.camp/@aparrish/110653106189480411): A few weeks ago I decided I wanted to be in charge of my own bookmarking infrastructure, so I exported my bookmarks from pinboard and spent the afternoon writing ~500 lines of Python/HTML/CSS/bash to make a lil bespoke database manager/static site generator. Pleased with the results.
