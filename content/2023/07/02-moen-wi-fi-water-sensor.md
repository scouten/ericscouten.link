via [Jerry Bellâ€‹](https://infosec.exchange/@jerry/110641148720533079): PSA: for about $50, you can buy a Wi-Fi water sensor (also senses temp and humidity) from Moen. I put them under my sinks and near my water heater, washing machine, and furnace/AC.

I did the same at my beach place and just got an alert of a leak, but I'm 400 miles away. So I called a maintenance person and sure enough, my AC unit is dumping water on the floor. On the 8th floor.

That little $50 puck just saved me and the people below me thousands.
