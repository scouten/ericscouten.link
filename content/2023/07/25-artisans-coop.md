via [Dave Polaschek](https://woodworking.group/@davepolaschek/110775245371163046): I joined artisans.coop a while back. If youâ€™re an artisan who might sell stuff, their lifetime deal is steep, but seems worthwhile, if only to give Etsy some much-needed competition. More in the blog post there.

_(NOTE: Dave originally linked to an offer to join as a lifetime member by the end of July. I'm not linking to that post because (a) I'm not joining at this time, and (b) this page -- and thus this link -- should be meaningful after 31 July.)_
