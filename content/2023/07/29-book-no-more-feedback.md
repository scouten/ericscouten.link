via [Olamina Free](https://eweg.be/@olamina/110798208290159784): You might want to look at Carol Sanford's book _No More Feedback._ Interesting framework as alternative to feedback.

Carol Sanford: [No More Feedback: Cultivate Consciousness at Work](https://carolsanford.com/no-more-feedback-cultivate-consciousness-at-work/)

From the book's page:

> Peer Review is the Foundation for Measuring Employee Performance
>
> But does it help employees realize their full potential? Does feedback improve a company’s bottom line?
>
> _No More Feedback: Cultivate Consciousness at Work_, book one in Carol Sanford’s new Toxic Practice book series disrupts commonly held beliefs to reveal:
> * Why feedback undermines employee development
> * The impact feedback has on our 3 core human capabilities
> * The alternative that leads to self-regulating employees
>
> Utilizing examples from Carol’s decades of work, learn the flaws in the feedback trap and build conditions for employees to flourish for long-term success.

_(My take: This is certainly a controversial take, perhaps intentionally provocative. I'm not sold, but I'm curious. Saving link for (maybe?) reading later. Given that it was raised in a Mastodon thread about how to de-escalate a heated discussion, I find it potentially interesting.)_
