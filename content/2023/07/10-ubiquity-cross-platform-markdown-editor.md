via [Rust Weekly](https://mastodon.social/@rust_discussions/110688676219533619): Ubiquity (v0.3.0) - I made a cross-platform markdown editor to learn some Rust. It uses Yew, Tauri, Tailwind and DaisyUI. Currently available on Windows, Linux and the web. _(Appears that a Mac version has been added since.)_
