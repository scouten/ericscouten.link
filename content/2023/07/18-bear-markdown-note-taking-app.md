_(My take: This is a loving review of a major app update. I'm not yet sold on the app, but that's because I'm a curmudgeon who has decided a git repo full of individual Markdown files is sufficient as a note-taking tool. If something were to replace that approach, something like Bear would be where I would look, which is why I'm saving the link.)_
