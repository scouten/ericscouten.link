via [Mike Bowler](https://hachyderm.io/@mike_bowler/110708989880198936): I’ve noticed anecdotally that for a development team, as WIP goes down, quality goes up. I’m thinking my way through how I would visualize that and any suggestions are welcome. I can easily pull WIP numbers out of Jira (all my clients use Jira - sigh). The trick is how to measure quality. Pulling number of bugs entered into Jira can be done but absence of bugs doesn’t prove quality. SonarQube has some technical quality data but quality is more than just code.
