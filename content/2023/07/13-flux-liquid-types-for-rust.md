So if I understand it correctly pre-conditions apply on what comes before the arrow of a function, and post-conditions (or `ensures` in Flux) apply to what comes after the arrow?

Or differently put: pre-conditions apply to function input, post-conditions apply to function output? Where mutable references are also considered a form of function output?
