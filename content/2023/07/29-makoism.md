Found this via Mastodon (probably a Lisa Melton boost, though I don't have the original source now):

[Makoism](https://makoism.com/) "is part blog, part-newsletter, and all experiment by Steve Makofsky."

_(My take: This is a fun weekly read to which I am now subscribed. I'm contemplating doing similar with my own newsletter. Stay tuned ...)_
