> Exciting news! ✨⁠
⁠>
> We've been keeping a secret for quite some time now and we're super excited to finally share the news with you! ⁠
⁠>
> Come alive with Nita Lake Lodge! All of our suites have been refurbished, along with our look. ⁠
⁠>
> We believe there’s no better way to awaken your senses than by connecting with the elements. ⁠
⁠>
> From warm fires & lake views, to rooftop hot tubs & water crafts, local seasonal cuisine and a luxury spa, every moment brings you closer to nature and each other. Located at the intersection of forest paths & bike trails, mountains and water, minutes away from Whistler Creekside, Nita Lake Lodge is an invitation to feel anew every day.⁠
⁠>
> We look forward to welcoming you. 

I stayed here some years ago and am excited to check out the renovation. (Not sure when ...)
