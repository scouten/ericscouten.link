via [Colin M. Ford](https://typo.social/@colinmford/110845331745668762): Does anyone have a link to original Avenir specimens/materials from ~1987 when it came out? The [Fonts In Use page](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/3409/avenir), usually my go-to for stuff like this, does not have any images linked, and when I search anywhere the results are just flooded with Typography 1 class assignments.

Fonts In Use: [Avenir](https://fontsinuse.com/typefaces/3409/avenir)

_(My take: 🙋‍♂️ old font geek here. Cool to see a new site focused on how fonts are used.)_
