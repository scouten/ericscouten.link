via [Dragan Stepanoviƒá](https://mastodon.social/@d_stepanovic/110923858489903469): If developers in your team have to repeat their asks or even worse beg üôè for reviewing their PRs (or any other help they need), your problem is not people not prioritizing other people's work, "lack of professionalism" or lack of "team player spirit."

<!-- more -->

> Your problem is the lack of availability in the team as a consequence of high WIP and high utilization.
>
> The amount of begging in the system is proportional to the WIP.

_(My take: Mmm hmmm.)_
