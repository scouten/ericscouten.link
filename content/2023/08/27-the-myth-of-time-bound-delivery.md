via [Bruno BaketariÄ‡](https://mastodon.social/@bbak/110960842631844396): "There's a commonly held myth that a lack of a time-bound delivery commitment, such as a sprint demonstration, will lead to a lack of focus, laziness, and increasingly long delivery times. There is, in fact, no such evidence from more than a decade of training and coaching for a living and wish to dissuade adoption of Kanban or customers from switching." (David J. Anderson, 2023 in 'Discovering Kanban', p. 108)

> The underlying myth or belief is that one needs a rather concrete, prescribed, envisioned, beneficial future state to accomplish anything - no matter if its called goal, objective or strategy.

> That myth is even more ubiquitous than Scrum adoption in some industries.

> Actually, a sense of direction is sufficient and prevents inattentional blindness to new opportunities - a side-effect of focus.

_(My take: I'm increasingly skeptical on Scrum as a project planning methodology and am on the search for viable alternatives to recommend. I may need to read this book, as Kanban in general feels more natural to me, but that's a gut feeling for me now. Would love to find more evidence to support that feeling.)_
