_(My take: I was an Elixir developer for a few years and was often surprised by the performance and reliability available in that environment. That said, being a VM with garbage collection has some inherent limits. Though I have no need to work in Elixir space any more, I do kind of dig this "optimize the most important parts" approach.)_
