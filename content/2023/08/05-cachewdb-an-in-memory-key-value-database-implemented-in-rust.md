via [Rust Weekly](https://mastodon.social/@rust_discussions/110838731820521638): CachewDB - An in-memory, key value database implemented in Rust

<!-- more -->

GitHub: [theopfr/cachew-db: A light weight, typed, in-memory, ordered, key-value database](https://github.com/theopfr/cachew-db)

_(My take: If I were building anything resembling a database from scratch these days, I'd be hard-pressed to choose any language other than Rust. Few places where correctness is more important.)_
