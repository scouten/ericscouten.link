<!-- more -->

Rough summary, as the transcript was not available as of this writing. Host Adam Stacoviak was sharing some of the guiding principles that his team uses when deciding whether to embark on new projects related to the podcast:

> We have a saying around here – three things, actually – the three pillars that guide us:
>
> 1. Keep the main thing the main thing.
> 2. Slow and steady wins.
> 3. If you're feeling like you're going too fast, slow down and check yourself.

> ...
>
> Pick your momentum, but if you feel like you're not able to keep up and the things that matter most to you, the main thing -- keep the main thing the main thing -- that's ... if you're losing your grip on that, slow down and check yourself. That's the rudders and the levers that we tend to pull having done this for 14+ years and making a living doing it.
