via [Jon Reid](https://iosdev.space/@qcoding/110958822877618429): @woolie I see very few teams functioning as teams.

_(My take: Jon is a former teammate of mine at Adobe; he has gone on to an illustrious career coaching developers and teams especially as regards test-driven development, iOS apps, and agile methods.)_
