Mike McQuaid: [More Effective Remote Working](https://mikemcquaid.com/more-effective-remote-working/)

_(My take: I've been working fully or partially remote for more than 30 years. A lot of what Mike says rings true from my experience. They keys IMHO are in strong written and verbal communication skills on **both** ends of a remote pipe **and** periodic face-to-face meetings to make the big decisions.)_
