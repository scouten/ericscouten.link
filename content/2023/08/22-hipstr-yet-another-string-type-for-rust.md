via [Rust Weekly](https://mastodon.social/@rust_discussions/110931849264608539): Way too many strings in Rust? You may just need one more, meet hipstr

_(My take: One of the appeals of Rust is that there's very little bikeshedding about common data types. When I'm importing code from someone else's crate, I know that they'll use the same string type, the same array type, the same memory management approach, and so on. This stands in sharp contrast to C++, where -- despite years of attempts at standardization after the fact -- there is little to no unity on such matters. That becomes a major roadblock to code reuse. Although there are some touted benefits to this crate, replacing concepts that are built in to the library is a hard sell for me.)_
