via [Johannes Ernst](https://social.coop/@J12t/110828285572200525): I don't think too many people in the Fediverse know of the groundbreaking, but quite accessible research Elinor Ostrom did on the Commons, which eventually won her the Nobel Price. Commons = a resource shared by a group and that together manages that resource for the good of all. ... Can we do better?

_(My take: I haven't read the full article, but I'm skeptical on the premise that the fediverse is a commons. One of the premises I see from Johannes' post is that a commons implies a finite set of resources, and I think the fediverse is effectively infinite. Given that, can we really think of the fediverse as a commons?)_
