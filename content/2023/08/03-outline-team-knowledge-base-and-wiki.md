via [Boris Mann](https://cosocial.ca/@boris/110823416036435132): I have literally pages and pages of research about #opensource #wiki so I just sort of assumed there’d be a decent on with #WordPress integration but I guess not! Outline has been on my shortlist previously, and we use a Discourse forum as a wiki at work.

_(My take: Not sure if I need a wiki, but this look intriguing ... 🤷🏻‍♂️)_
