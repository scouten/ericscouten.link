via [Thomas Steiner :chrome:](https://toot.cafe/@tomayac/110860403617635844): ðŸ“¢ The Origin Private File System (OPFS) is a cross-browser solution for your performance-critical, file-based storage needs on the Web!  @chrisdavidmills has documented everything you need to know about the API over on MDN.

ðŸ’¡ This is what powers Photoshop (https://developer.chrome.com/blog/how-photoshop-solved-working-with-files-larger-than-can-fit-into-memory/) and SQLite Wasm (https://developer.chrome.com/blog/sqlite-wasm-in-the-browser-backed-by-the-origin-private-file-system/).
