Via [Andreas Gohr](https://octodon.social/@splitbrain/109632151358016846): Yesterday I added more than 300 more blogs to [indieblog.page](https://indieblog.page/) which I got from [bringback.blog](https://bringback.blog/). If you want to discover new #blogs to read you might want to check out both projects.
