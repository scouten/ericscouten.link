StreetPass is a cool new browser extension that uses Mastodon's verification system in a clever way. Mastodon users verify themselves by adding a custom link to their personal site. StreetPass lets you know when you've found one of these links, and adds them to your list. As you browse the web, StreetPass will build a list of Mastodon users that belong to the websites you visit.
