Emily F. Gorcenski: [How I Read 40 Books and Extinguished the World on Fire](https://emilygorcenski.com/post/how-i-read-40-books-and-extinguished-the-world-on-fire/)

> The world’s on fire. We scroll and scroll and scroll past the bombings and the shootings and the yelling and the blaming and not to mention the climate, right, and even the economy, too. Everything’s bad and we’re all depressed. Wake up, scroll. Lay down, scroll. The nightmare rectangle glowing misery in our faces every day and every night.
