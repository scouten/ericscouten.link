via [Rasmus Andersson](https://mastodon.social/@rsms/110617120973955870): Playbit is an endeavor to build a new operating system for software creatives. After over two years of research, Playbit is now a real company and I'm hiring Playbit's founding engineers.

**NOTE:** I'm happy where I'm at, and these are in-person (San Francisco-only) positions.

Will be interesting to see how this project evolves, though.
