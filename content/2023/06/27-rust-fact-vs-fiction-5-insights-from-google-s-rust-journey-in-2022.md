tl;dr:

* Rumor 1: Rust takes more than 6 months to learn – Debunked!
* Rumor 2: The Rust compiler is not as fast as people would like – Confirmed!
* Rumor 3: Unsafe code and interop are always the biggest challenges – Debunked!
* Rumor 4: Rust has amazing compiler error messages – Confirmed!
* Rumor 5: Rust code is high quality – Confirmed!

These largely match my own experience.
