via [Simon Gray](https://indieweb.social/@simongray/110558411470636703): The Danish artist Thomas Dambo put up these large, wooden trolls all around Denmark. They are located in various hidden or hard-to-get-to places, making them perfect as destinations for hikes (or bike rides).

I plan to visit a whole bunch of them with my son in our cargo bike during the upcoming summer holiday.
