via [David Amador](https://mastodon.gamedev.place/@djlink/110610953499148736): I don't see it mentioned enough times but Fork is one of the best git clients around imo, lightweight, simple and it just works. Win & Mac, free to try and one time purchase.

FWIW I'm a happy [SourceTree](https://sourcetreeapp.com) user, but I do like to keep my eyes open for other git client apps.
