via [llimllib](https://vis.social/@llimllib/110079495520921776): Every time I set up a new mac, I update my install script that gets things most of the way installed for me.

<!-- more -->

Here's the newest version, in case it's helpful to anybody: 

- ask you for your new computer's name and set it
- set a bunch of preferences
- install homebrew and a base set of packages, both CLI and apps
- install programming language environments with `asdf`

The script's been in (very intermittent) development for 7 years now!
