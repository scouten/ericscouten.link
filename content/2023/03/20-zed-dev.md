via [Stefan Baumgartner](https://mastodon.social/@deadparrot/110055198364614599): Giving zed.dev another spin. It's fast and it's beautiful, really. It's a pleasure to look at it and the original theme is very balanced. It feels very snappy, especially when you get LSP feedback. I miss inlay hints, but I'm sure they will end up one way or another.
