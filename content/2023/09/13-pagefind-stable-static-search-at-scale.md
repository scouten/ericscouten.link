via [Liam Bigelow](https://fosstodon.org/@bglw/111059193837190797): Pagefind 1.0 is here! âœ¨

<!-- more -->

> Thrilled to get this one out the door â€”Â content weighting, sub results, and a new indexing API are just some of the new features, plus improvements across the board to make Pagefind faster at returning better results ðŸ¤© And all without the bandwidth creeping up on us.

GitHub: [CloudCannon/pagefind: Release Pagefind v1.0.0 â€” Stable static search at scale âœ¨ ðŸš€](https://github.com/CloudCannon/pagefind/releases/tag/v1.0.0)

_(My take: Ooh, this looks interesting. I'm satisfied enough with the static-site search I'm using now, but saving this link in case it doesn't scale for me.)_
