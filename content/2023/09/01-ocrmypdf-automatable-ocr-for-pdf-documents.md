via [Uwe Schwarz ッ�](https://infosec.exchange/@e38383/110989984199658456): @rauschma if you additionally want OCR, take a look at ocrmypdf (installable via brew), it can reduce file size *and* add OCR-data to make PDFs searchable. Combine that with an Automator-Workflow for a folder and you get a real easy way to compress and OCR all PDFs.
