via [smallcircles (Humane Tech Now)](https://social.coop/@smallcircles/110988848400866723): Yes, you can ditch #GoogleMaps now. #OrganicMaps is here. Use it while offline and feel good about a #privacy-respecting app that doesn't suck you dry of your personal information. Based on #OpenStreetMap this app is gonna blow #Google #Maps out of the water (hopefully ;)

_(My take: I stopped using Google Maps a couple of years ago. However, I left it in favor of Apple Maps, which has matured tremendously since its very rough beginnings. That may be a higher bar for Organic Maps to overcome. That said, I do use OSM to reconstrct parts of GPS track logs that are missing or recorded poorly by my phone when traveling.)_
