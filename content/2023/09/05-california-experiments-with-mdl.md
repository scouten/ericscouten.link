Debbie Truong for _Los Angeles Times_: [Californians can carry driver's license on phone in pilot program](https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2023-09-03/californians-can-now-carry-drivers-licenses-on-their-phone-as-part-of-pilot-program)

_(My take: Despite Rahardja's skeptical take, I think this is likely a net positive. I'm encouraged to see governments increasingly participate in digital identity efforts. Dear Washington state, when are you going to join in?)_
