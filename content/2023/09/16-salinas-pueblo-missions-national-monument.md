via [Dave Polaschek](https://woodworking.group/@davepolaschek/111077796140316291): On Thursday, we stopped by the Quarai Ruins at the Salinas Pueblo Missions National Monument, and it was pretty dang photogenic.

_(My take: My travels only rarely take me through [New Mexico](https://ericscouten.travel/state/new-mexico/), but I'll definitely file this away for when I'm back. Thanks for the pointer, Dave!)_
