via [heckj](https://mastodon.social/@heckj/110386173337115520): @nugmanoff and I have just cut an initial release of [YSwift](https://swiftpackageindex.com/y-crdt/yswift), an MIT licensed open source Swift CRDT library that is powered by the Rust implemention of Yjs.

<!-- more -->

Of more interest to me, given my Rust background, is the underlying Rust crate, **yrs**, which describes itself as a High-performance implementation of a similar JavaScript library.
