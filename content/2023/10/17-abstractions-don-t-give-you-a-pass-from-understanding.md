via [Dave Copeland :ruby:](https://ruby.social/@davetron5000/111250498052198101): One thing I have learned over many years is that you **must** understand whatever an abstraction is abstracting in order to both evaluate it and wield it effectively. I call this the Katz Conjecture after Yehuda Katz mentioning this in a conference talk:

_(My take: This absolutely matches my own experience. The **promise** of an abstraction is that it trades away a complex concept for a simpler one. But ... when an abstraction leaks -- and this **often** happens -- you wind up needing to have deep understanding of **both** the abstraction layer **and** the thing it was intending to "simplify" away. So ... beware the hidden costs of abstractions.)_
