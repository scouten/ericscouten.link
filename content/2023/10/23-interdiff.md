(In response to an earlier post:)

> A concept I feel ought to exist, but doesn't exist, in software development is the "diff diff". In other words, if there are two separate patches performing a similar function, I want to see the difference between those two patches. I've been thinking about this for years but I don't think I've ever seen it and I don't even know what word to use to describe it.

_(My take: A reliable source for `interdiff` seems hard to find, but the tool sounds interesting if it can be found. Closest match I could find was this:)_
