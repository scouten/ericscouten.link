via [Quinn “The Eskimo!”](https://toot.community/@justkwin/111215712463381706): TIL that a US food labelling fluid ounce is exactly 30 mL.

<!-- more -->

From _Wikipedia_ [Fluid ounce](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_ounce):

> A US customary fluid ounce is 1⁄16 of a US liquid pint and 1⁄128 of a US liquid gallon or exactly 29.5735295625 mL, making it about 4.08% larger than the imperial fluid ounce.

> A US food labeling fluid ounce is exactly 30 mL.

_(My take: Seriously? We have two definitions for fluid ounce that are 1.4% different from each other -- and also different by a few more percent from the "imperial" (UK) definition? This makes just about zero sense to me. Why, America, why? Also: Why have we **not** converted to metric already? Time for this nonsense to end.)_
