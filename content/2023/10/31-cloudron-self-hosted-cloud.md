via [Boris Mann](https://cosocial.ca/@boris/111328547860470213): I’m slowly replacing various services with my #selfhosting Cloudron server.

Nextcloud is a bit clunky, but it has a LOT included: mobile &amp; desktop apps and sync (Dropbox replacement), contact &amp; calendaring that worked first try on iOS as CardDAV and CalDAV servers. 

Moving Rachael’s WordPress site had me grumbling, but that’s WP - plus a little help from DO Spaces + UpdraftPlus plugin.
