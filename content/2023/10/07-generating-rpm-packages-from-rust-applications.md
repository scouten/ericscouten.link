via [Fabio Valentini](https://mastodon.social/@decathorpe/111194386950624412): I just wrapped up feature development for rust2rpm v25 (the tool we use in  crates and applications). I've been dogfooding the latest code for a few days now, and some of the changes make package maintenance much nicer - further reducing the need for manual changes.

<!-- more -->

The last steps before tagging v25.0.0 are writing the release notes and adding some actual documentation - maybe even write manpages for rust2rpm and its configuration file formats ðŸ¤“
