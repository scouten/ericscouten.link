via [Martijn Faassen](https://fosstodon.org/@faassen/111224221245768721): One of the things I like to do when winding down is watch Jared Rydelek (Weird Explorer) taste some unusual fruit and review it. I am years behind in his voluminous archive of videos so there is always more to watch. So many types of fruit, it's wonderful!

_(My take: I enjoy the genre of **every** \_\_\_ in \_\_\_, so much so that I am running on myself: [146 Parks](https://146parks.blog), which is literally "every state park in Washington." I got sucked into Jared's 700th episode in which he recounts how his quest to taste every fruit in the world has taken him to many corners of the world and yielded many surprises, both pleasant and unpleasant. Very well produced!)_
