## Comments

* Florence, Siena, San Gimignano (local wine is Vernaccia), Montepulciano (Vino Nobile), Montalcino (Brunello), Greve in Chianti. Pisa very quickly, maybe Lucca. In other words, stay in Tuscany! Maybe I would include Monaco, Carcassonne, San Sebastian, Santiago di Compostella.

* We liked Evora in Portugal, so that's one place to consider stopping on the way to Lisbon.

* A side trip to Morocco, the Algarve (southern Portugal), Porto in the north (for great port wines!). While in Florence, the Galleria degl Uffizi - A. Must. Stop! I could go on and on ...

* I forgot the Museo Galileo, housing Galileo's instruments and other artifacts from the 15/16th centuries. It is a great visit.

* My German friend says take the costal road in northern Italy to Nice. Skip Monaco; nothing really to see there. Stop in San Tropez. 30 min in Pisa. Wind tour way through southern France on scenic routes to Spain.

* Panzano En Chianti is worth a visit for Dario Cecchini's restaurants. (The hotel Sangiovese there is quite nice. It is a tiny little enclave.) There is a large outdoor sculpture garden nearer to Siena.

* In Florence, Michelangelo's David is my #1. Climbing up Santa Maria del Fiore, #2. Heading NW ... hiking Cinque Terre was well worth it and rife with photo opportunities.
