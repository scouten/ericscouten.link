## Comments

* I've been playing around lightly with [Plex](https://www.plex.tv) as an in home media server (for how often kids stream same movies from iTunes, storing and playing local makes much more sense). For just a player, I've heard good things about [Tomahawk](https://github.com/tomahawk-player/tomahawk) too. **2023 Update:** Looks like Tomahawk was abandoned circa 2020.

* I've been using [Roon](https://roon.app/en/) for a while, and I like it.

* Try [WALTR](https://waltr-2.en.softonic.com/mac).

* I have [Swinsian](https://swinsian.com). It seems good, but I actually don't use it a lot because I use Spotify a lot.
